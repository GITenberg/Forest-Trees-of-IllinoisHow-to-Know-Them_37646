Two-thirds natural size.</p></div>

<p><span style="float: left; font-size: 2.8em; line-height: .8em; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 2px; padding-bottom: 0px;">T</span>HE white pine is found along the bluffs overlooking Lake
Michigan in Lake and Cook counties and is also scattered
along river bluffs in Jo Daviess, Carroll, Ogle and LaSalle counties.
The only grove of this beautiful tree in Illinois is in the
White Pines Forest State Park near Oregon, Ogle County, where
there are trees over 100 years old that have attained a height of
90 feet with a diameter of 30 inches. This tree formerly formed
the most valuable forests in the northeastern United States,
stretching from Maine through New York to Minnesota. The
straight stem, regular pyramidal shape and soft gray-green
foliage made it universally appreciated as an ornamental tree and
it has been freely planted throughout the State.</p>

<p>The <i>leaves</i>, or needles, are 3 to 5 inches in length, bluish-green
on the upper surface and whitish beneath, and occur in
bundles of 5, which distinguishes it from all other eastern pines.
The pollen-bearing <i>flowers</i> are yellow and clustered in cones,
about &#8531; inch long at the base of the growth of the season. The
seed-producing flowers occur on other twigs and are bright red
in color. The cone, or <i>fruit</i>, is 4 to 6 inches long, cylindrical
with thin usually very gummy scales, containing small, winged
seeds which require two years to mature.</p>

<p>The <i>wood</i> is light, soft, durable, not strong, light brown in
color, often tinged with red, and easily worked. It was formerly
much used in old colonial houses where even the shingles were
of white pine. It is excellent for boxes, pattern making, matches,
and many other products.</p>

<p>Its rapid growth and the high quality of the wood make it one
of the best trees for reforestation on light soils in the northern
part of the State. The white pine blister rust was introduced into
America about 35 years ago, and has since become widespread
and highly destructive of both old trees and young growth.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Austrian pine, <i>Pinus nigra</i> Arnold, has been naturalized in Lake
County and has been planted as an ornamental tree throughout the State.
Its leaves in 2&#8217;s, from 3 to 5 inches long, stiff and dark green. The cone is
heavy, 3 inches long with short prickles.</p></div>

<p><span style="float: left; font-size: 2.8em; line-height: .8em; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 2px; padding-bottom: 0px;">T</span>HE shortleaf pine, sometimes called yellow pine, occurs in
very small stands in the &#8220;Pine Hills&#8221; of Union County, in
Jackson County, in Giant City State Park, and near &#8220;Piney
Creek&#8221; in Randolph County. It forms forests on light sandy soils
in Tennessee, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Texas. At maturity, the
tree has a tall, straight stem and an oval crown, reaching a
height of about 100 feet and a diameter of about 4 feet.</p>

<p>The <i>leaves</i> are in clusters of two or three, from 3 to 5 inches
long, slender, flexible, and dark blue-green. The cones are the
smallest of our pines, 1&frac12; to 2&frac12; inches long, oblong, with small
sharp prickles, generally clustered, and often holding to the twigs
for 3 or 4 years. The <i>bark</i> is light brownish-red, broken into
rectangular plates on the trunk but scaly on the branches.</p>

<p>The <i>wood</i> of old trees is rather heavy and hard, of yellow-brown
or orange color, fine grained and less resinous than that
of other important southern pines. It is used largely for interior
and exterior finishing, general construction, veneers, paper pulp,
excelsior, cooperage, mine props, and other purposes. The tree
transplants readily, grows rapidly, succeeds on a variety of soils
and has proved valuable for reforestation.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A few trees of jack pine, <i>Pinus banksiana</i> Lamb., are found in Lake
County. It is a small northern tree with leaves about an inch long, borne in
2&#8217;s, with cones about 2 inches long. It is planted for reforestation in the
State. The Scots pine, <i>Pinus sylvestris</i> L., has been freely planted in Illinois
and may be known by its orange-brown bark and its twisted leaves 2 to 3
inches long, arranged in 2&#8217;s. It has become naturalized on the sand dunes
in Lake County.</p>

<p>The Norway spruce, <i>Picea abies</i> Karst., has been freely planted
throughout the State. It forms a dense conical spire-topped crown and
reaches a height of 50 to 70 feet. The leaves are needle-shaped, about an inch
long, dark green, and persist for about 5 years. The pendulous cones are
from 3 to 6 inches long. It is desirable for ornamental planting.</p></div>

<p><span style="float: left; font-size: 2.8em; line-height: .8em; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 2px; padding-bottom: 0px;">T</span>HE bald cypress is a tree found exclusively in deep swamps
and was found in southern Illinois from the Mississippi bottoms
to Shawneetown. Its straight trunk with numerous ascending
branches, and narrow conical outline makes the tree one of
considerable beauty. In old age, the tree generally has a broad
fluted or buttressed base, a smooth slowly tapering trunk and a
broad, open, flat top of a few heavy branches and numerous
small branchlets. The original-growth timber attained heights
of 80 to 130 feet and diameters of 5 to 10 feet.</p>

<p>The <i>bark</i> is silvery to cinnamon-red and finely divided by
numerous longitudinal fissures. The <i>leaves</i> are about &frac12; to &frac34;
of an inch in length, arranged in feather-like fashion along two
sides of small branchlets, which fall in the autumn with the
leaves still attached.</p>

<p>The <i>fruit</i> is a rounded cone, or &#8220;ball&#8221;, about one inch in
diameter, consisting of thick irregular scales.</p>

<p>The <i>wood</i> is light, soft, easily worked, varies in color from
light to dark brown, and is particularly durable in contact with
the soil. Hence it is in demand for exterior trim of buildings,
greenhouse planking, boat and shipbuilding, shingles, posts, poles
and crossties.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The tamarack, or American larch, <i>Larix laricina</i> K. Koch, resembles
the bald cypress in growing in swamps and in shedding its leaves in autumn.
This tree is found in Illinois growing in bogs in Lake and McHenry counties.
The leaves are flat, soft, slender, about one inch long and borne in clusters.
The cones are only &frac12; to &frac34; inch long. The European larch, <i>Larix decidua</i>
Mill., may be distinguished from the native species by having slightly longer
leaves and larger cones that are more than an inch long.</p></div>

<h4><b>RED CEDAR</b> <i>Juniperus virginiana</i> L.</h4>

<p><span style="float: left; font-size: 2.8em; line-height: .8em; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 2px; padding-bottom: 0px;">R</span>ED cedar, the most plentiful coniferous tree in the State, is
very valuable, growing on a great variety of soils, seeming
to thrive on hills where few other trees are found. It is more
common in the southern counties.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 375px;"><a name="f7" id="f7"></a><img src="images/illus-007.png" width="375" height="295" alt=

<p class="center">RED CEDAR<br />
Natural size.</p></div>

<p>There are two kinds of <i>leaves</i>, often both kinds being found
on the same tree. The commoner kind is dark green, minute and
scale-like, clasping the stem in four ranks, so that the stems
appear square. The other kind, often appearing on young growth
or vigorous shoots, is awl-shaped, quite sharp-pointed, spreading
and whitened beneath. The two kinds of <i>flowers</i>, appearing in
February or March, are at the ends of the twigs on separate
trees. The staminate trees assume a golden color from the small
catkins, which, when shaken, shed clouds of yellow pollen. The
<i>fruit</i>, ripening the first season, is pale blue with a white bloom,
&frac14; inch in diameter, berry-like with sweet flesh. It is a favorite
winter food for birds.</p>

<p>The <i>bark</i> is very thin, reddish-brown, peeling off in long,
shred-like strips. The tree is extremely irregular in its growth,
so that the trunk is usually more or less grooved.</p>

<p>The <i>heartwood</i> is distinctly red, and the sapwood white, this
color combination making very striking effects when finished for
cedar chests, closets, and interior woodwork. The wood is aromatic,
soft, strong, and of even texture, and these qualities make
it most desirable for lead pencils. It is very durable in contact
with the soil, and on that account is in great demand for posts,
poles and rustic work.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The arbor vitae or northern white cedar, <i>Thuja occidentalis</i> L., is found
occasionally on the bluffs overlooking Lake Michigan, on the cliffs of Starved
Rock, in Elgin City Park, and in bogs in Lake County. The leaves are
aromatic, scale-like, &#8539; inch long, arranged to give small flat branches. The
fruit is a cone &frac12; inch long. The wood is light, soft, durable, fragrant, and
pale brown.</p></div>

<h4><b>QUAKING ASPEN</b> <i>Populus tremuloides</i> Michx.</h4>

<p><span style="float: left; font-size: 2.8em; line-height: .8em; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 2px; padding-bottom: 0px;">T</span>HIS is one of the most widely distributed trees in North
America. Its range goes from Labrador to British Columbia
and from New England and New York far south in the Rocky
Mountains to Arizona. In Illinois it is common in the north, but
of infrequent occurrence in the south.</p>

<p class="center">ASPEN<br />
Three-fourths natural size.</p></div>

<p>The aspen is a small tree, reaching heights of 40 to 60 feet
and diameters of 10 to 20 inches. The young branches are reddish-brown
soon turning gray. The <i>winter buds</i> are about &frac14;
inch long, pointed and shining. The <i>bark</i> is thin, smooth, light
gray tinged with green.</p>

<p>The <i>leaves</i> are on slender flat petioles, arranged alternately
on the twigs, and broadly oval, short pointed and shallowly
toothed. They are green, shiny above and dull below, ranging
from 2 to 4 inches long and about the same in breadth.</p>

<p>The <i>flowers</i> are in catkins and appear before the leaves
begin to expand. The two kinds are borne on separate trees, the
staminate catkins are about 2 inches long, but the seed-producing
flowers form a long slender cluster 4 inches in length. The <i>fruit</i>
is a conical capsule filled with tiny cottony seeds which ripen in
late spring before the leaves are fully expanded.</p>

<p>The <i>wood</i> is light brown, almost white. It is light, weak and
not durable, and is used for pulpwood, fruit-crates and berry
boxes.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The large-tooth aspen, <i>Populus grandidentata</i> Michx., is found in the
northern half of Illinois and frequently grows alongside the quaking aspen.
Its leaves are larger than those of the quaking aspen and the edges are
coarsely and irregularly toothed. The winter buds have dull chestnut-brown
scales and are somewhat downy. The bark is light gray tinged with reddish-brown.</p></div>

<h4><b>COTTONWOOD</b> <i>Populus deltoides</i> Marsh.</h4>

<p><span style="float: left; font-size: 2.8em; line-height: .8em; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 2px; padding-bottom: 0px;">T</span>HE cottonwood, or Carolina poplar, is one of the largest
trees in Illinois, growing on flood plains along small streams
and in depressions in the prairie. It is one of the best trees for
forestry purposes for planting where quick shade is desired.
The wood is soft, light, weak, fine-grained but tough. It is good
for pulp, boxes and berry baskets.</p>

<p class="center">COTTONWOOD<br />
Leaf, one-third natural size.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twig, one-third natural size.</p>

<p>The <i>leaves</i> are simple, alternate, broadly triangular, pointed
and coarse toothed on the edges, 3 to 5 inches across, thick and
firm supported by flattened slender petioles, 2 to 3 inches long.
The <i>winter buds</i> are large and covered with chestnut-brown
shining resinous scales.</p>

<p>The <i>flowers</i> are in catkins, of two kinds, on different trees
and appear before the leaves. The <i>fruit</i> ripens in late spring,
appearing as long drooping strings of ovoid capsules filled with
small seeds. These strings of fruit, 5 to 8 inches long, give to
the tree the name of &#8220;necklace poplar.&#8221; The seeds are covered
with white cottony hairs.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The swamp cottonwood, <i>Populus heterophylla</i> L., occurs in swamps in
the southern part of Illinois, and may be known by its broadly ovate leaves,
3 to 5 inches wide and 4 to 7 inches long with blunt-apex and cordate base.
A few trees of the balsam poplar, <i>Populus tacamahaca</i> Mill., are found in
Lake County near the shores of Lake Michigan. The leaves are ovate-lanceolate,
pointed, and cordate. The large buds are covered with fragrant
resin.</p>

<p>The European white poplar, <i>Populus alba</i> L., with light gray bark and
leaves, white wooly beneath, is often found near old houses and along roadsides.
The Lombardy poplar, a tall narrow form of the European black
poplar, <i>Populus nigra</i> var. <i>italica</i> Du Roi, is often planted and is a striking
tree for the roadside.</p></div>

<p><span style="float: left; font-size: 2.8em; line-height: .8em; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 2px; padding-bottom: 0px;">T</span>HE black willow is not only a denizen of the forest but it is
at home on the prairies and on the plains and even invades
the desert. It grows singly or in clumps along the water courses,
a tree 40 to 60 feet in height with a short trunk.</p>

<p>The <i>bark</i> is deeply divided into broad flat ridges, often
becoming shaggy. The twigs, brittle at the base, are glabrous
or pubescent, bright red-brown becoming darker with age. The
<i>winter buds</i> are &#8539; inch long, covered with a single smooth scale.
The <i>wood</i> is soft, light, close-grained, light brown and weak. It
is often used in the manufacture of artificial limbs.</p>

<p>The alternate simple <i>leaves</i> are 3 to 6 inches long, and one-half
inch wide on very short petioles; the tips are much tapered
and the margins are finely toothed. They are bright green on
both sides, turning pale yellow in the early autumn. The <i>flowers</i>
are in catkins, appearing with the leaves, borne on separate
trees. The staminate flowers of the black willow have 3 to 5
stamens each, while the white willow has flowers with 2 stamens.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The native peach-leaved willow, <i>Salix amygdaloides</i> Anders., is a
smaller tree with leaves 2 to 6 inches long, &frac12; to 1&frac12; inches wide, light
green and shining above, pale and glaucous beneath, on petioles about &frac34;
inch long.</p>

<p>The white willow, <i>Salix alba</i>, L., and the crack willow, <i>Salix fragilis</i> L.,
with bright yellow twigs, are European species which are often planted for
ornamental purposes. Their flowers have only 2 stamens each and their

<p><span style="float: left; font-size: 2.8em; line-height: .8em; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 2px; padding-bottom: 0px;">T</span>HIS valuable forest tree occurs on rich bottom lands and on
moist fertile hillsides throughout the State. The black walnut
is found from Massachusetts westward to Minnesota and
southward to Florida and Texas. In the forest, where it grows
singly, it frequently attains a height of 100 feet with a straight
stem, clear of branches for half its height. In open-grown trees,
the stem is short and the crown broad and spreading.</p>

<p>The <i>bark</i> is thick, dark brown in color, and divided by rather
deep fissures into rounded ridges. The twigs have cream-colored
chambered pith and leaf-scars without downy pads above.</p>

<p>The <i>leaves</i> are alternate, compound, 1 to 2 feet long, consisting
of from 15 to 23 leaflets of yellowish-green color. The
leaflets are about 3 inches long, extremely tapering at the end
and toothed along the margin.</p>

<p>The <i>fruit</i> is a nut, borne singly or in pairs, and enclosed in
a solid green husk which does not split open, even after the nut
is ripe. The nut itself is black with a very hard, thick, finely
ridged shell, enclosing a rich, oily kernel edible and highly nutritious.</p>

<p>The <i>heartwood</i> is of superior quality and value. It is heavy,
hard and strong, and its rich chocolate-brown color, freedom
from warping and checking, susceptibility to a high polish, and
durability make it highly prized for a great variety of uses,
including furniture, cabinet work, and gun-stocks. Walnut is
easily propagated from the nuts and grows rapidly on good soil,
where it should be planted and grown for timber and nuts. It is
the most valuable tree found in the forests of Illinois and originally
grew extensively throughout the State.</p>

<p><span style="float: left; font-size: 2.8em; line-height: .8em; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 2px; padding-bottom: 0px;">T</span>HE butternut, sometimes called the white walnut, is a
smaller tree than the black walnut, although it may reach a
height of 70 feet and a diameter of 3 feet. It is found all over
the State, but the best is in the ravines of southern Illinois.
The butternut is found from Maine to Michigan and southward
to Kansas, Tennessee and northern Georgia. The trunk is often
forked or crooked and this makes it less desirable for saw timber.</p>

<p>The <i>bark</i> differs from that of the black walnut in being
light gray on branches and on the trunk of small trees, becoming
darker on large trees. This tree may also be distinguished from
black walnut by the velvet collars just above the scars left by
last year&#8217;s leaves. The twigs have chocolate-brown chambered
pith and bear obliquely blunt winter buds somewhat flattened,
brownish and hairy.</p>

<p>The compound <i>leaves</i> are 15 to 30 inches long, each with
11 to 17 sharp-pointed, oblong, finely toothed leaflets 2 to 3 inches
long.</p>

<p>The staminate and pistillate <i>flowers</i> are on the same tree,
the former in long yellowish-green drooping catkins and the
latter are short with red-fringed stigmas.</p>

<p>The <i>fruit</i> is a nut enclosed in an oblong, somewhat pointed,
yellowish-green husk, about 2 inches long, which is covered with
short, rusty, clammy, sticky hairs. The nut has a rough, grooved
shell and an oily, edible kernel.</p>

<p>The <i>wood</i> is light, soft, not strong, coarse-grained, light
brown, and takes a good polish. It is used for interior finish of
houses and for furniture. A yellow or orange dye can be made
from the husks of the nuts.</p>

<p><span style="float: left; font-size: 2.8em; line-height: .8em; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 2px; padding-bottom: 0px;">T</span>HE bitternut hickory is a tall slender tree with broadly
pyramidal crown, attaining a height of 100 feet and a diameter
of 2 to 3 feet. It is found along stream banks and on moist
soil, and it is well known by its roundish bitter nuts.</p>

<p>The <i>bark</i> on the trunk is granite-gray, faintly tinged with
yellow and smoother than in most of the hickories, yet broken
into thin plate-like scales. The <i>winter buds</i> are compressed,
scurfy, and of a bright yellow color.</p>

<p>The <i>leaves</i> are alternate, compound, from 6 to 10 inches
long, and composed of from 7 to 11 leaflets. The individual
leaflets are smaller and more slender than those of the other
hickories.</p>

<p>The <i>flowers</i> are of two kinds on the same tree; the staminate
in long pendulous green catkins, the pistillate in 2 to 5
flowered spikes, &frac12; inch long, brown-hairy. The <i>fruit</i> is about
1 inch long and thin-husked, while the nut is usually thin-shelled
and brittle, and the kernel very bitter.</p>

<p>The <i>wood</i> is hard, strong and heavy, reddish-brown in color.
From this last fact it gets its local name of red hickory. It is
said to be somewhat inferior to the other hickories, but is used
for the same purposes.</p>

its range northward to Adams, Peoria, Fayette and
Lawrence counties. The tree is the largest of the hickories, attaining
heights of over 100 feet and, when in the open, forming
a large rounded top of symmetrical shape. It makes an excellent
shade tree and is also planted in orchards for its nuts. The outer
<i>bark</i> is rough, hard, tight, but broken into scales; on the limbs,
it is smooth at first but later tends to scale or divide as the bark
grows old.</p>

<p>The <i>bark</i> of the trunk is rougher than other hickories, light
gray and separating into thick plates which are only slightly
attached to the tree. The terminal <i>winter buds</i> are egg-shaped,
the outer bud-scales having narrow tips.</p>

<p>The <i>leaves</i> are alternate, compound, from 8 to 15 inches long,
and composed of 5, rarely 7 obovate to ovate leaflets. The twigs
are smooth or clothed with short hairs.</p>

<p>The <i>fruit</i> is borne singly or in pairs and is globular. The
husk is thick and deeply grooved at the seams. The nut is much
compressed and pale, the shell thick, and the kernel sweet. The
flowers are of two kinds, opening after the leaves have attained
nearly their full size.</p>

<p>The <i>wood</i> is heavy, hard, tough and strong; it is white
largely in the manufacture of agricultural implements and tool
handles, and the building of carriages and wagons. For fuel
the hickories are the most satisfactory of our native trees.</p>

rare in Illinois. It is found in Jo Daviess and Carroll counties and along
the shores of Lake Michigan. The white papery bark distinguishes it from
all other trees and was used by the northern Indians for covering their
canoes and for making baskets, bags and other useful and ornamental
things.</p></div>

<h4><b>RIVER BIRCH</b> <i>Betula nigra</i> L.</h4>

<p><span style="float: left; font-size: 2.8em; line-height: .8em; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 2px; padding-bottom: 0px;">T</span>HE river, or back birch, is at home, as the name implies,
along water courses, and inhabits the deep, rich soils along
the borders of the larger rivers of the State and in swamps which
are sometimes inundated for weeks at a time.</p>

<p class="center">RIVER BIRCH<br />
Two-thirds natural size.</p>

<p>The <i>bark</i> provides a ready means of distinguishing this
tree. It varies from reddish-brown to cinnamon-red in color, and
peels back in tough papery layers. These layers persist on the
trunk, presenting a very ragged and quite distinctive appearance.
Unlike the bark of our other birches, the thin papery
layers are usually covered with a gray powder. On older trunks,
the bark on the main trunk becomes thick, deeply furrowed and
of a dark reddish-brown color.</p>

<p>The <i>leaves</i> are simple, alternate, 2 to 3 inches long, more or
less oval in shape, with double-toothed edges. The upper surface
is dark green and the lower a pale yellowish-green.</p>

<p>The <i>flowers</i> are in catkins, the two kinds growing on the
same tree. The <i>fruit</i> is cone-shaped about 1 inch long, and
densely crowded with little winged nutlets that ripen from May
to June.</p>

<p>The <i>wood</i> is strong and fairly close-grained. It has been
used to some extent in the manufacture of woodenware, in
turnery and for wagon hubs.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The yellow birch, <i>Betula lutea</i> Michx., one of the most valuable hardwood
timber trees around the Great Lakes, is represented in Illinois by a
few small trees in Lee and Lake counties. It may be known by its bark becoming
silvery-gray as the trunk expands and breaking into strips curled at
the edges. The wood is strong and hard, close-grained, light brown tinged
with red. It is used for interior finish, furniture, woodenware and turnery.
It is prized as firewood.</p></div>

<h4><b>BEECH</b> <i>Fagus grandifolia</i> Ehrh.</h4>

<p><span style="float: left; font-size: 2.8em; line-height: .8em; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 2px; padding-bottom: 0px;">T</span>HE beech is found from Maine to Wisconsin south to the
Gulf and Texas, growing along with maples, oaks and tulip
trees. It occurs in the ravines of the southern Illinois counties
up to Vermilion County. It is one of the most beautiful of all
trees either in summer or winter.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 430px;"><a name="f22" id="f22"></a><img src="images/illus-022.png" width="430" height="289" alt=
"BEECH" title="" /></div>

<p class="center">BEECH<br />
One-half natural size.</p>

<p>The <i>bark</i> is, perhaps, the most distinctive characteristic,
as it maintains an unbroken light gray surface throughout its
life. So tempting is this smooth expanse to the owner of a jack-knife
that the beech has been well designated the &#8220;initial tree.&#8221;</p>

<p>The simple, oval <i>leaves</i> are 3 to 4 inches long, pointed at the
tip and coarsely toothed along the margin. When mature, they
are almost leathery in texture. The beech produces a dense shade.
The <i>winter buds</i> are long, slender and pointed.</p>

<p>The little, brown, three-sided beech-nuts are almost as well
known as chestnuts. They form usually in pairs in a prickly
bur. The kernel is sweet and edible, but so small as to offer
insufficient reward for the pains of biting open the thin-shelled
husk.</p>

<p>The <i>wood</i> of the beech is very hard, strong, and tough,
though it will not last long on exposure to weather or in the soil.
It is used to some extent for furniture, flooring, carpenter&#8217;s tools,
and novelty wares and extensively in southern Illinois for railroad
ties and car stock.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The American chestnut, <i>Castanea dentata</i> Borkh., extends its range
from Maine to Michigan, and southward to Delaware and Tennessee. There
is a stand of chestnuts in Pulaski County and some trees have been planted
in the southern part of the State. They are easily recognized by their alternate
simple, broadly lanceolate coarsely toothed leaves, and their prickly
burs about 2 inches in diameter containing 1-3 nuts.</p></div>

<h4><b>WHITE OAK</b> <i>Quercus alba</i> L.</h4>

<p><span style="float: left; font-size: 2.8em; line-height: .8em; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 2px; padding-bottom: 0px;">W</span>ITHIN its natural range, which includes practically the
entire eastern half of the United States, the white oak is
one of the most important timber trees. It commonly reaches a
height of 60 to 100 feet and a diameter of 2 to 3 feet; sometimes
it becomes much larger. It is found in a wide variety of upland
soils. When grown in a dense stand it has a straight continuous
trunk, free of side branches for over half its height. In the open,
however, the tree develops a broad crown with far-reaching
limbs. Well-grown specimens are strikingly beautiful.</p>

<p class="center">WHITE OAK<br />
Twig, one-third natural size.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaf, one-quarter natural size.</p>

<p>The <i>leaves</i> are alternate, simple 5 to 9 inches long and about
half as broad. They are deeply divided into 5 to 9 rounded,
finger-like lobes. The young leaves are a soft silvery-gray or
yellow or red while unfolding, becoming later bright green above
and much paler below. The <i>flowers</i> appear with the leaves, the
staminate are in hairy catkins 2-3 inches long, the pistillate are
sessile in axils of the leaves.</p>

<p>The <i>fruit</i> is an acorn maturing the first year. The nut is
&frac34; to 1 inch long, light brown, about one-quarter enclosed in the
warty cup. It is relished by hogs and other livestock. The <i>bark</i>
is thin, light ashy-gray and covered with loose scales or broad
plates.</p>

<p>The <i>wood</i> is useful and valuable. It is heavy, strong, hard,
tough, close-grained, durable, and light brown in color. The uses
are many, including construction, shipbuilding, tight cooperage,
furniture, wagons, implements, interior finish, flooring, and fuel.
Notwithstanding its rather slow growth, white oak is valuable
for forest, highway and ornamental planting.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The overcup oak, <i>Quercus lyrata</i> Walt., is similar to the white oak,
but may be distinguished by the nearly spherical cup which nearly covers
the somewhat flattened acorn. This oak occurs in the river bottoms in
southern Illinois.</p></div>

<p><span style="float: left; font-size: 2.8em; line-height: .8em; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 2px; padding-bottom: 0px;">T</span>HE bur oak, which occurs throughout the State takes its
name from the fringe around the cup of the acorn. It usually
has a broad top of heavy spreading branches and a relatively
short body. It is one of the largest trees in the State. In maturity,
it attains a diameter of 5 feet or more and a height of over
80 feet. The <i>bark</i> is light gray and is usually broken up into
small narrow flakes. The bur oak does not often form a part of
the forest stand, as do some other oaks, but occurs generally
singly in open stands and in fields. It requires a moist but well-drained
soil.</p>

<p>The <i>leaves</i> resemble somewhat those of the common white
oak, but have a pair of deep indentations on their border near
the base, and wavy notches on the broad middle and upper portions
of the leaf. They range from 6 to 12 inches long and 3 to 6
inches wide. The <i>fruit</i>, or acorn, is a nut set deeply in a fringed
cup. It is sometimes 1 inch or more in diameter but varies
widely in respect to size and the degree to which the nut is
enclosed in the mossy fringed cup.</p>

<p>The <i>wood</i> is heavy, hard, strong, tough and durable. It is
used for much the same purposes as the other white oaks, lumber,
piling, veneer logs, crossties and fuel.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The swamp white oak, <i>Quercus bicolor</i> Willd., occurs scattered in
swamps, through the State. The leaves are obovate, coarsely toothed and
wedge-shaped below. They are thick, dark green and shining above, pale
and downy beneath. The acorns are borne in a deep rough scaly cup, on
stems 2-4 inches long. The wood is like that of the white oak. The bark is
gray-brown, separating into large, papery scales which curl back.</p></div>

<p><span style="float: left; font-size: 2.8em; line-height: .8em; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 2px; padding-bottom: 0px;">T</span>HIS oak, also called the chinquapin oak, which is an excellent
timber tree, occurs throughout the State. It grows on practically
all classes of soil and in all moisture conditions except in
swamps, and is a very tenacious tree on shallow, dry soil. The
<i>bark</i> is light gray, and breaks up into short narrow flakes on the
main trunk and old limbs. It reaches a height of 70 to 90 feet.
The straight shapely trunk bears a round-topped head composed
of small branches, which makes it an attractive shade tree.</p>

<p>The <i>leaves</i> are oblong, 3 to 6 inches in length, 1&frac12; to 3 inches
wide, and equally toothed or notched on the edges, resembling
the leaves of the chestnut oak. The <i>fruit</i>, which ripens in the fall
of the first season, is light to dark brown when ripe, and edible if
roasted. This acorn is from one-half to nearly an inch long,
usually less than one inch in diameter, and is set in a shallow cup.</p>

<p>The <i>wood</i> is like that of the white oak, heavy, very hard,
tough, strong, durable, and takes an excellent polish. It is used
in manufacturing lumber and timbers, crossties, fence posts and
fuel. A portion of the lumber no doubt goes into furniture.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The basket oak, or swamp chestnut oak, <i>Quercus prinus</i> L., is found
in the woods in southern Illinois. It resembles the white oak in its bark
and branches, but has larger acorns. The leaves resemble those of yellow

<p><span style="float: left; font-size: 2.8em; line-height: .8em; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 2px; padding-bottom: 0px;">T</span>HE post oak is usually a medium-sized tree, with a rounded
crown, commonly reaching a height of 50 to 80 feet and a
diameter of 1 to 2 feet, but sometimes considerably larger. It
occurs from Mason County south to the Ohio River being most
common in the &#8220;Post Oak Flats.&#8221; The soil is a light gray silt
loam underlaid by &#8220;tight clay.&#8221;</p>

One-third natural size.</p>

<p>The <i>bark</i> is rougher and darker than the white oak and
broken into smaller scales. The stout young twigs and the leaves
are coated at first with a thick light-colored fuzz which soon
becomes darker and later drops away entirely.</p>

<p>The <i>leaves</i> are usually 4 to 5 inches long and nearly as broad,
deeply 5-lobed with broad rounded divisions, the lobes broadest
at the ends. They are thick and somewhat leathery, dark green
and shiny on the upper surface, lighter green and rough hairy
beneath.</p>

<p>The <i>flowers</i>, like those of the other oaks, are of two kinds
on the same tree, the male in drooping, clustered catkins, the
female inconspicuous. The <i>fruit</i> is an oval acorn, &frac12; to 1 inch
long, set in a rather small cup which may or may not be stalked.</p>

<p>The <i>wood</i> is very heavy, hard, close-grained, light to dark
brown, durable in contact with the soil. It is used for crossties
and fence posts, and along with other oaks of the white oak class
for furniture and other purposes.</p>

<p><span style="float: left; font-size: 2.8em; line-height: .8em; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 2px; padding-bottom: 0px;">T</span>HE red oak of the North occurs throughout the State. It
usually attains a height of about 70 feet and a diameter
ranging from 2 to 3 feet, but is sometimes much larger. The
forest-grown tree is tall and straight with a clear trunk and
narrow crown.</p>

<p class="center">NORTHERN RED OAK<br />
Leaf, one-third natural size.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twig, one-half natural size.</p>

<p>The <i>bark</i> on young stems is smooth, gray to brown on older
trees, thick and broken by shallow fissures into regular, flat
smooth-surfaced plates.</p>

<p>The <i>leaves</i> are simple, alternate, 5 to 9 inches long, and 4
to 6 inches wide, broader toward the tip, divided into 7 to 9 lobes,
each lobe being somewhat coarsely toothed and bristle-tipped,
and firm, dull green above, paler below, often turning to a brilliant
red after frost. The <i>winter buds</i> are small, light reddish-brown
and smooth. The <i>flowers</i>, as in all the oaks, are of two
kinds on the same tree, the staminate in long drooping, clustered
catkins, opening with the leaves, the female solitary or slightly
clustered. The <i>fruit</i> is a large acorn maturing the second year.
The nut is from &frac34; to 1&frac34; inches long, blunt-topped, flat at base,
with only its base enclosed in the very shallow dark brown cup.</p>

<p>The <i>wood</i> is hard, strong, coarse-grained, with light, reddish-brown
heartwood and thin lighter-colored sapwood. It is
used for cooperage, interior finish, construction, furniture, and
crossties. Because of its average rapid growth, high-grade wood
and general freedom from insect and fungus attack, it should
be widely planted in the State for timber production and as a
shade tree.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This red oak, <i>Quercus shumardii</i> Buckley, is found only in the southern
counties along the borders of streams and swamps. Its leaves are dark
green and lustrous, paler beneath and have tufts of pale hairs in the angles
of the veins. The acorns are long-oval in shape, held in thick saucer-like
cups composed of closely appressed hairy scales.</p></div>

<p><span style="float: left; font-size: 2.8em; line-height: .8em; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 2px; padding-bottom: 0px;">T</span>HE black oak, sometimes farther north called yellow oak or
yellow-barked oak, usually grows to be about 80 feet in
height and 1 to 3 feet in diameter. It is found commonly throughout
the State. The crown is irregularly shaped and wide, with
a clear trunk for 20 feet or more on large trees. The <i>bark</i> on the
very young trees is smooth and dark brown but soon becomes
thick and black, with deep furrows and rough broken ridges.
The bright yellow color and bitter taste of the inner bark, due
to tannic acid, are distinguishing characteristics.</p>

<p class="center">BLACK OAK<br />
Leaf, one-third natural size.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twig, one-half natural size.</p>

<p>The <i>leaves</i> are alternate, simple, 5 to 10 inches long and 3
to 8 inches wide, thick leathery shallow or deeply lobed, the shape
varying greatly. When mature, the leaves are dark green and
shiny on the upper surface, pale on the lower, more or less covered
with down, and with conspicuous rusty brown hairs in the
forks of the veins.</p>

<p>The <i>winter buds</i> are large, strongly angled, gray and hairy.
The <i>fruit</i> matures the second season. The light brown nut is
from &frac12; to 1 inch long, more or less hemispherical in shape, and
from &frac12; to &frac34; enclosed in the thin, dark brown, scaly cup. The
scales on the upper part of the cup are loosely imbricated. The
kernel is yellow and extremely bitter.</p>

<p>The <i>wood</i> is hard, heavy, strong, coarse-grained and checks
easily. It is a bright red-brown with a thin outer edge of paler
sapwood. It is used for the same purposes as red oak, under
which name it is put on the market. Its growth is rather slow.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The jack oak, <i>Quercus ellipsoidalis</i> Hill, is a smaller tree found frequently
alongside black oak in the northern third of the State. The acorn
is ellipsoid, small and enclosed in a deep cup, whose scales are closely appressed.
The winter buds are slightly angular, smooth, and red-brown in
color. Many small, drooping branches are sent out near the ground, which
soon die, and the stubs or &#8220;pins&#8221; have given this oak the name of northern
pin oak.</p></div>

<p><span style="float: left; font-size: 2.8em; line-height: .8em; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 2px; padding-bottom: 0px;">P</span>IN oak is rarely found naturally except on the rich moist soil
of bottom lands and the borders of swamps. It is usually not
abundant in any locality, but found scattered with other kinds
of trees. It more commonly attains heights of 50 to 70 feet, with
diameters up to 2 feet, but sometimes larger. The tree commonly
has a single, upright stem with numerous long, tough branches,
the lower ones drooping, the middle horizontal, and the upper
ascending. Many of the lower branches soon die and their stubs
are the &#8220;pins&#8221; which give the tree its name.</p>

<p class="center">PIN OAK<br />
Leaf, one-third natural size.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twig, one-half natural size.</p>

<p>The <i>bark</i> on young stems is smooth, shining and light
brown; on old trunks light gray-brown and covered by small,
close scales. Because of its beauty, its hardiness, and its fairly
rapid growth, pin oak makes an exceptionally fine street tree.</p>

<p>The <i>leaves</i> generally resemble those of the northern red oak,
but they are smaller and much more deeply lobed. They are 3 to
5 inches long and 2 to 4 inches wide.</p>

<p>The <i>flowers</i> are of two kinds on the same tree, and appear
when the leaves are about one-third grown. The <i>fruit</i>, taking
two years to mature, is an acorn nearly hemispheric, about one-half
inch long, light brown, often striped, enclosed only at the
base in a thin, shallow, saucer-shaped cup.</p>

<p>The <i>wood</i> is heavy, hard, strong, and usually knotty. It is
light brown, with thin, darker-colored sapwood. It is sold and
has the same uses as red oak, although it is generally not so good
in quality.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The scarlet oak, <i>Quercus coccinea</i> Muench., has deeply lobed leaves
which turn brilliant scarlet in the autumn. The winter buds are reddish-brown
and pubescent. The acorns are ovoid, enclosed for about half their
length in a thick, deep cup. It is rarely found in the southern half of the
State.</p></div>

Virginia and Florida to Texas and Missouri, and appears in
a dozen of the southern counties in Illinois. It is usually called
the Spanish oak, or southern red oak, and has been known as

Leaf, one-third natural size.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twig, one-half natural size.</p>

<p>It is a variable species and hence has been known under so
many names. It grows to a height of 70 to 80 feet, and a diameter
of 2 to 3 feet, though larger trees are not infrequently found.
Its large spreading branches form a broad, round, open top.</p>

<p>The <i>bark</i> is rough, though not deeply furrowed and varies
from light gray on younger trees to dark or almost black on older
ones.</p>

<p>The <i>leaves</i> are of two different types: (1) irregular-shaped
lobes, mostly narrow, bristle-tipped, the central lobe often the
longest; or (2) pear-shaped with 3 rounded lobes at the outer
end. They are dark lustrous green above and gray downy beneath,
the contrast being strikingly seen in a wind or rain storm.</p>

<p>The <i>flowers</i> appear in April while the leaves are unfolding.
The <i>fruit</i> ripens the second year. The small rounded acorn,
about half an inch long, is set in a thin saucer-shaped cup which
tapers to a short stem.</p>

<p>The <i>wood</i> is heavy, hard, strong, coarse-grained and is less
subject to defects than most other red oaks. It is used for rough
lumber and for furniture, chairs, tables, etc. It is a desirable
timber tree, especially on the poorer, drier soils. The bark is
rich in tannin.</p>

<p><span style="float: left; font-size: 2.8em; line-height: .8em; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 2px; padding-bottom: 0px;">T</span>HE black jack oak is a tree of sandy and clayey barren lands
where few other forest trees thrive. It ranges from New
York to Florida and westward into Illinois, Arkansas, and Texas.
It reaches its largest size in southern Arkansas and eastern
Texas. It is found as one of the main species in the &#8220;Post Oak
Flats&#8221; in the southern half of the State and in the sands along
the Illinois River, near Havana. The tree sometimes reaches
a height of 50 to 60 feet and a diameter of 16 inches, but it is
usually much smaller. Its hard, stiff, drooping branches form
a dense crown which usually contains many persistent dead
twigs. The <i>bark</i> is rough, very dark, often nearly black, and
broken into small, hard scales or flakes.</p>

the extreme north portion. When growing alone, the tree
develops a symmetrical rounded top, conspicuous on account of
the good-sized, regular-shaped, oblong leaves which differ in

<p>The <i>leaves</i> are alternate, simple, 4 to 6 inches long, rather
thick, somewhat one-sided, doubly toothed on the margin, and
generally smooth above and downy below. The leaf-veins are
very pronounced and run in parallel lines from the mid-rib to
leaf edge. The <i>winter buds</i> are pointed, brown, ovoid and smooth.</p>

<p>The <i>flowers</i> are small, perfect, greenish, on slender stalks
sometimes an inch long, appearing before the leaves in the early
spring. The <i>fruit</i> is a light green, oval shaped samara (winged
fruit) with the seed portion in the center and surrounded entirely
by a wing. This wing has a conspicuous notch at the end and
is hairy on the margin, a mark distinctive of the species. The
seed ripens in the spring and by its wing is widely disseminated
by the wind.</p>

<p>The <i>wood</i> is heavy, hard, strong, tough and difficult to split.
It is used for hubs of wheels, saddle trees, boats, ships, barrel
hoops, and veneer for baskets and crates.</p>

<p>Because of its spreading fan-shaped form, graceful pendulous

however, on various types of soil, from the poorest to the richest.
It is usually a medium-sized tree from 30 to 50 feet high and 10
to 20 inches in diameter, but trees 3 feet in diameter are found
in the Wabash bottoms in southern Illinois. Its limbs are often
crooked and angular and bear a head made of slender, pendant
branches or short, bristly, stubby twigs. In the open the crown
is generally very symmetrical. It makes an excellent shade tree.</p>

<p><span style="float: left; font-size: 2.8em; line-height: .8em; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 2px; padding-bottom: 0px;">T</span>HE osage orange, hedge apple, or mock orange, although not
a native of Illinois, is found distributed throughout the State,
but does not as a rule occur as a forest tree. It grows chiefly in
open fields along fence rows, and as a pure hedge fence. Occasionally
it reaches a height of 60 feet and a diameter of 30
inches, but more usually it is found from 20 to 40 feet in height
and from 4 to 12 inches in diameter. This tree is sometimes used
for shade, but mostly for hedges, and as living fence posts. The
<i>bark</i> is thin, gray, sometimes tinged with yellow, and on old
trees divided into strips or flakes. The bark of the root is used as
a yellow dye; that of the trunk has been used for tanning leather.</p>

Leaf and fruit, one-quarter natural size.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twig, two-thirds natural size.</p>

<p>The <i>leaves</i> are deciduous, with milky sap and producing
stout axillary thorns. They are green on the upper surface, 3 to
5 inches long and 2 to 3 inches wide, and turn bright yellow
in the autumn.</p>

<p>The yellowish <i>flowers</i> appear in May. They are of two kinds
on the same tree&mdash;the staminate flowers in a linear cluster and
the pistillate flowers in a rounded ball. The <i>fruit</i> is globular,
from 2 to 5 inches in diameter, somewhat resembling a very
rough green orange.</p>

<p>The <i>wood</i> is heavy, exceedingly hard, very strong and very
durable in contact with the soil. The heartwood is bright orange
in color, turning brown upon exposure. The Indians called it
&#8220;bois d&#8217;arc&#8221;, or bow-wood, and used it for their finest bows. It
does not shrink with weather changes. It is largely used for
posts; sometimes for wheel-stock, lumber and fuel.</p>

<p>The <i>bark</i> is rather thin, dark reddish-brown, peeling off in
long narrow flakes.</p>

<p>The <i>leaves</i> are alternate, thin, rounded or somewhat heart-shaped,
toothed, pointed, 3 to 5 inches long, rough hairy above
and soft hairy beneath. Often some of the leaves, especially on
the young trees and thrifty shoots, are mitten-shaped or variously
lobed.</p>

<p>The <i>flowers</i> are of two kinds, on the same or different trees,
in drooping catkins. The catkins of the staminate flowers are
about 2 inches long; the spikes of the pistillate flowers are about
half as long and stand on short stalks. The <i>fruit</i> is dark red or
black, and resembles a blackberry; however, a stalk extends
through it centrally, and it is longer and narrower. The fruit
is sweet and edible and greatly relished by birds and various
animals.</p>

<p>The <i>wood</i> is rather light, soft, not strong, light orange-yellow,
very durable in contact with the soil. It is chiefly used
for fence posts. The tree might be planted for this purpose and
to furnish food for birds.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The white mulberry, <i>Morus alba</i> L., is a native of China, where its
leaves are the chief food of the silkworm. Several varieties are planted for
ornamental purposes. Its leaves are broad and smooth; its fruit is long,
white, sweet, and insipid. A variety, under the name of the Russian mulberry,
<i>Morus alba</i> var. <i>tatarica</i> Loudon, has been introduced into this country
and has been cultivated for its fruit. This fruit varies from creamy white
to violet and almost black.</p></div>

edges, dark green above, lighter beneath.</p>

<p>The <i>flowers</i> are single, large&mdash;though smaller than those
of the other magnolias&mdash;2&frac12; to 3 inches long. The six upright
petals are whitish-green tinged with yellow.</p>

<p>The <i>fruit</i> is a smooth, dark red, often crooked &#8220;cone&#8221;, 2&frac12;
to 3 inches long, somewhat resembling, when green, a small
cucumber. The seeds are &frac12; inch long, and covered with a pulpy,
scarlet coat, which attracts the birds, particularly as the seeds
hang by thin cords from the opening &#8220;cones.&#8221;</p>

<p>The <i>wood</i> is light, soft, close-grained, durable, of a light
yellow-brown color and is used for the same purposes as yellow

<h4><b>TULIP TREE</b> <i>Liriodendron tulipifera</i> L.</h4>

<p><span style="float: left; font-size: 2.8em; line-height: .8em; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 2px; padding-bottom: 0px;">T</span>HE tulip tree, tulip poplar, is one of the tallest trees in the
State with its straight trunk rising to a height of 125 feet.
It is one of the largest and most valuable hardwood trees of the
United States. It reaches its largest size in the deep moist soils
along streams and in the cool ravines of southern Illinois. Vermilion
County on the east and Randolph on the west side of the
State represent its northern limit. As more commonly seen, it
has a height of 60 to 100 feet and a diameter of 3 to 4 feet. Growing
with a straight central trunk like the pines, and often clear
of limbs for 30 to 50 feet, it has a narrow pyramidal head which
in older age becomes more spreading. The tree has been extensively
cut, but is reproducing rapidly and remains one of the most
abundant and valuable trees in our young second-growth forests.
It has been planted as an ornamental and shade tree.</p>

<p class="center">TULIP TREE<br />
Leaf, one-third natural size.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twig, two-thirds natural size.</p>

<p>The <i>leaves</i> are simple, 4 to 6 inches in length and breadth,
4-lobed, dark green in summer, turning to a clear yellow in fall.</p>

<p>The greenish-yellow tulip-shaped <i>flowers</i> appear in May or
June. The <i>fruit</i> is a narrow light brown, upright cone, 2 to 3
inches long, made up of seeds, each enclosed in a hard bony coat
and provided with a wing which makes it easily carried by the
wind.</p>

<p>The <i>wood</i> is light, soft, easily worked, light yellow or brown,
with wide cream-colored sapwood. It is extensively cut into
lumber for interior and exterior trim, vehicle bodies, veneers,
turnery and other high-grade uses. It is marketed under the
name yellow poplar, because of the yellow color of the heartwood.</p>

<p>The tulip tree transplants easily, grows rapidly and forms
a tall stem. It is one of the best trees for forest planting on good
moist soil. It can be recommended for roadside planting because
it grows tall and has a deep root system. Where conditions of
life are not too severe, it may be used for shade tree planting.</p>

<p><span style="float: left; font-size: 2.8em; line-height: .8em; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 2px; padding-bottom: 0px;">T</span>HE papaw, which grows as a small tree or large shrub, is
very well known throughout the State, except in the northern
parts, and is sometimes called the &#8220;wild banana&#8221; tree. Most
commonly it occurs as an undergrowth in the shade of rich
forests of the larger hardwood trees. Its range extends from
New York westward to Iowa and southward to Florida and
eastern Texas. When growing alone, however, it forms dense
clumps on deep, moist soils in creek bottoms. The <i>bark</i> is thin,
dark grayish-brown, and smooth, or slightly fissured on old trees.</p>

<p>The dark purple, attractive <i>flowers</i> appear with the leaves
singly or in two&#8217;s along the branch, measure nearly 2 inches
across, and produce nectar which attracts the bees.</p>

<p>When thoroughly ripe, the <i>fruit</i> is delicious and nutritious.
It measures from 3 to 5 inches in length, turns from greenish-yellow
to very dark brown in color, and holds rounded or elongated
seeds which separate readily from the pulp.</p>

<p>The <i>wood</i> is light, soft or spongy, and weak, greenish to
yellowish in color, and of no commercial importance.</p>

<p>Because of its handsome foliage, attractive flowers and
curious fruit, the papaw has been much used in ornamental
planting.</p>

<h4><b>SASSAFRAS</b> <i>Sassafras albidum</i> Nees.</h4>

<p><span style="float: left; font-size: 2.8em; line-height: .8em; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 2px; padding-bottom: 0px;">T</span>HE sassafras is an aromatic tree, usually not over 40 feet in
height or a foot in diameter in Illinois. It is common throughout
the State on dry soils as far north as La Salle County, and is
one of the first broad-leaf trees to come up on abandoned fields,
where the seeds are dropped by birds. Its range extends from
Maine, southern Ontario to Iowa and south to Florida and west
to Texas. In parts of its range it attains large size.</p>

<p class="center">SASSAFRAS<br />
Twig, one-half natural size.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaf, one-third natural size.</p>

<p>The <i>bark</i> of the trunk is thick, red-brown and deeply furrowed
and that of the twigs is bright green.</p>

<p>The <i>leaves</i> are very characteristic. It is one of the few trees
having leaves of widely different shape on the same tree, or even
on the same twig. Some are oval and entire, 4 to 6 inches long;
others have one lobe, resembling the thumb on a mitten; while
still others are divided at the outer end into 3 distinct lobes. The
young leaves and twigs are quite mucilaginous.</p>

<p>The <i>flowers</i> are clustered, greenish, yellow, and open with
the first unfolding of the leaves. The staminate and pistillate
flowers are usually on different trees. The <i>fruit</i> is an oblong,
dark blue or black, lustrous berry, containing one seed and surrounded
at the base by what appears to be a small orange-red
or scarlet cup at the end of a scarlet stalk.</p>

<p>The <i>wood</i> is light, soft, weak, brittle, and durable in the soil;
the heartwood is dull orange-brown. It is used for posts, rails,
boat building, cooperage and for ox-yokes. The bark of the roots
yields the very aromatic oil of sassafras much used for flavoring
candies and various commercial products.</p>

<p>The sassafras deserves more consideration than it has received
as a shade and ornamental tree. The autumnal coloring
of its foliage is scarcely surpassed by any tree, and it is very free
from insect pests.</p>

<p><span style="float: left; font-size: 2.8em; line-height: .8em; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 2px; padding-bottom: 0px;">T</span>HE sweet or red gum is a very common tree on low lands in
southern Illinois, but it is seldom found north of Jackson
County in the west or north of Richland in the east. It is usually
abundant in old fields or in cut-over woods. The <i>bark</i> is a light
gray, roughened by corky scales, later becoming deeply furrowed.
After the second year the twigs often develop 2 to 4 corky
projections of the bark, which give them a winged appearance.</p>

<p>The simple, alternate star-shaped <i>leaf</i>, with its 5 to 7 points
or lobes, is 5 to 7 inches across and very aromatic. In the fall its
coloring is brilliant, ranging from pale yellow through orange
and red to a deep bronze.</p>

<p>The <i>flowers</i> are of two kinds on the same tree, unfolding
with the leaves. The <i>fruit</i> at first glance reminds one of the balls
of the sycamore, but on closer inspection proves to be a head. It
measures an inch or more in diameter and is made up of many
capsules with projecting spines. It frequently hangs on the tree
by its long swinging stem late into the winter.</p>

<p>The <i>wood</i> is heavy, moderately hard, close-grained, and not
durable on exposure. The reddish-brown heartwood, which suggests
the name, red gum, is not present to any appreciable extent
in logs under 16 inches in diameter. In the South, the wood is
extensively used for flooring, interior finish, paper pulp and
veneers for baskets of all kinds. Veneers of the heartwood are
largely used in furniture, sometimes as imitation mahogany or
Circassian walnut. This tree should be more widely planted for
ornamental use.</p>

hardwood tree in North America. It occurs throughout
the State, but is most abundant and reaches its largest size along
streams and on rich bottom lands. It is one of the more rapidly-growing
trees. In maturity it occasionally attains a height of
140 to 170 feet and a diameter of 10 to 11 feet. It often forks
into several large secondary trunks, and the massive spreading
limbs form an open head sometimes 100 feet across.</p>

Leaf, one-third natural size.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twig, one-half natural size.</p>

<p>The <i>bark</i> of the sycamore is a characteristic feature. On the
younger trunk and large limbs it is very smooth, greenish-gray
in color. The outer bark yearly flakes off in large patches and
exposes the nearly white younger bark. Near the base of the old
trees the bark becomes thick, dark brown and divided by deep
furrows. The <i>flowers</i> are very small and arranged in dense
globular green heads.</p>

<p>The <i>leaves</i> are simple, alternate, 4 to 7 inches long and about
as broad, light green and smooth above, and paler below. The
base of the leafstalk is hollow and in falling off exposes the
winter bud. The <i>fruit</i> is a ball about 1 inch in diameter, conspicuous
throughout the winter as it hangs on its flexible stem,
which is 3 to 5 inches long. During early spring, the fruit ball
breaks up, and the small seeds are widely scattered by the wind.</p>

<p>The <i>wood</i> is hard and moderately strong, but decays rapidly
in the ground. It is used for butchers&#8217; blocks, tobacco boxes,
furniture and interior finish.</p>

<p>The tree grows rapidly, bears transplanting well and is
often planted as a shade tree.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The European sycamore or London plane tree, <i>Platanus acerifolia</i>
Willd., is less subject to disease than our native species and has been widely
planted in this country for ornament and shade. The leaves are more deeply
lobed than our sycamore and there are two or three fruit balls on each stem.</p></div>

color, while on the trunk the thicker bark often breaks into scales.
The twigs are at first hoary-hairy, but soon become smooth and
reddish.</p>

<p>The <i>leaves</i> are alternate, simple, 3 to 4 inches long and almost
as broad. They are sometimes slightly lobed and sharply
and deeply toothed. They are dark green and shiny above, but
pale and hairy beneath, borne on stout, hairy petioles.</p>

<p>The <i>flowers</i>, which are from one to two inches broad, are
borne in clusters of 3 to 8, on wooly pedicels about an inch long.
The white or rosy petals form a cup which surrounds the numerous
stamens and the five styles. The calyx is pubescent.</p>

<p>The <i>fruit</i> ripens in October, forming a globose, pale green,
very fragrant apple with a waxy surface. It is about an inch in
diameter, flattened at each end.</p>

<p>Like the other crabs, its handsome flowers have a delicious
fragrance which makes the tree popular for planting for ornamental
purposes. The fruit is sometimes gathered for jelly. The
<i>wood</i> is heavy, close-grained and reddish-brown.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The wild sweet crab, <i>Malus coronaria</i> Mill., differs from the above in
having more nearly smooth leaves and calyx. It is rarely found in Illinois

yellow sweetish pulp and seeds. The seeds are very hard
and each is separated from the others by the pulp. The pods are
eaten by many animals, and as the seeds are hard to digest, many
are thus widely scattered from the parent tree.</p>

<p>The <i>wood</i> is coarse-grained, hard, strong and moderately
durable in contact with the ground. It is used for fence posts and
crossties. It should not be confused with the very durable wood

length which remain attached to the outer bark for many years.
The <i>bark</i> is dark brown and divides into strips as the tree grows
older.</p>

<p>The <i>leaves</i> are pinnate, or feather-like, from 6 to 10 inches
in length, consisting of from 7 to 19 oblong thin leaflets.</p>

<p>The <i>flowers</i> are fragrant, white or cream-colored, and appear
in early spring in graceful pendent racemes. The <i>fruit</i>
is a pod from 3 to 5 inches long containing 4 to 8 small hard
seeds which ripen late in the fall. The pod splits open during the
winter, discharging the seeds. Some seeds usually remain attached
to each half of the pod; the pod thus acts as a wing
upon which the seeds are borne to considerable distances before
the strong spring winds.</p>

<p>The <i>wood</i> is yellow in color, coarse-grained, very heavy,
very hard, strong, and very durable in contact with the soil. It
is used extensively for fence posts, poles, tree nails, insulator
pins and occasionally for lumber and fuel.</p>

<p>The tree is very rapid in growth in youth but short-lived.
It spreads by underground shoots and is useful for holding and
reclaiming badly gullied lands. The usefulness of the black locust
is, however, very greatly limited by the fact that it is subject to
great damage from an insect known as the locust borer.</p>

the magnolias in the South. In Illinois it is a common and favorite
tree throughout the State. In the open it grows fairly rapidly
and has a very symmetrical, dense crown, affording heavy shade.
It is, therefore, quite extensively planted as a shade tree. The
<i>bark</i> on young trees is light gray and brown and rather smooth,
but as the tree grows older, it breaks up into long, irregular
plates or scales, which vary from light gray to almost black. The
twigs are smooth and reddish-brown, and the <i>winter buds</i> are
smooth and sharp-pointed. The tree attains a height of more
than 100 feet and a diameter of 3 feet or more. The sap yields
maple sugar and maple syrup.</p>

those of red maple.</p>

<p>The <i>flowers</i> appear in the spring before the leaves, in
dense clusters, and are of a greenish-yellow color. The <i>fruit</i>
ripens in late spring. It consists of a pair of winged seeds or
&#8220;keys&#8221; with wings 1 to 2 inches long on slender, flexible, threadlike
stems about an inch long.</p>

<p>The <i>wood</i> is soft, weak, even-textured, rather brittle, easily
worked, and decays readily when exposed. It is considerably
used for boxboards, furniture, veneers and fuel.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The red maple, or swamp maple, <i>Acer rubrum</i> L., has leaves deeply
lobed with the lobes sharply toothed. The autumn color is deep red. The

<h4><b>BOX ELDER</b> <i>Acer negundo</i> L.</h4>

<p><span style="float: left; font-size: 2.8em; line-height: .8em; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 2px; padding-bottom: 0px;">T</span>HE box elder is a fairly rapidly growing tree, found commonly
along streams rather generally over the State. It is
a tree of medium size, rarely reaching over 24 inches in diameter
and 60 to 70 feet in height. It has been considerably planted for
shade because in good soil its growth is rapid. Its limbs and
branches, however, are fragile, and the tree as a whole is rather
subject to disease. It is not long-lived or generally satisfactory
for any purpose. It is prolific in reproduction but is largely
destroyed by grazing and cultivation.</p>

<p>The <i>bark</i> on young branches is smooth and green to purple
in color; on old trees it is thin, grayish to light brown and
deeply divided.</p>

<p>The <i>leaves</i> are compound, with usually 3 leaflets (rarely 5
or 7), opposite, smooth and lustrous, green, and borne on a
leaf stem or petiole 2 to 3 inches long. The leaflets are 2 to 4
inches long by 1 to 2 inches wide, making the whole leaf 5 to
8 inches in length.</p>

<p>The <i>fruit</i> is a samara, or key, winged similarly to that of a
sugar maple, but smaller. It ripens in late summer or early
fall, and so is like its close relative, the sugar maple, but unlike
its close relatives, the red maple and silver maple.</p>

<p>The <i>wood</i> is soft, light, weak, close-grained and decays
readily in contact with heat and moisture. It is used occasionally
for fuel.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Norway maple, <i>Acer platanoides</i> L., is a European species which
has been extensively planted. It forms a round, spreading crown of stout
branches with coarse twigs. The leaves resemble those of the sugar maple
but somewhat broader and the petioles exude a milky juice when cut. The
flowers are larger than those of our native maples and fruit is large with
diverging wings. It holds its leaves longer in the fall and the autumn coloring
is pale yellow. It succeeds well as a city shade tree.</p></div>

knotty. The crown or head, is generally open and made up of
small spreading branches and twigs orange-brown to reddish-brown
in color. The <i>bark</i> is light gray and, on old trees, divided
or broken into flat scales, which make the stem of the tree rough;
the bark is ill-smelling when bruised.</p>

a broad, round-topped crown. It ranges throughout Illinois
and may be found wherever rich, wooded slopes, moist stream
banks and cool ravines occur. It grows best in river bottoms,
where it is common and forms a valuable timber tree, attaining a
height of 80 feet and a diameter of 4 feet. The <i>bark</i> is light
brown, deeply furrowed and the inner bark furnishes bast for
making mats.</p>

<p class="center">BASSWOOD<br />
Leaf, one-third natural size.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twig, one-half natural size.</p>

<p>The <i>leaves</i> are broadly heart-shaped, 3 to 6 inches long,
coarsely saw-toothed, smooth on both sides, except for some hairs
on the axils of the veins. They are dark above but light green
beneath.</p>

<p>The <i>flowers</i> are yellowish-white, in drooping clusters opening
in early summer, and flower stem is united to the middle of
a long narrow leaf-like bract. They are very fragrant and from
them the bees make a large amount of choice grade honey.</p>

<p>The <i>fruit</i> is a berry-like, dry, 1 or 2 seeded, rounded nutlet
&frac14; to &frac12; an inch in diameter, covered with short, thick and
brownish wool. It remains attached in clusters to the leafy bract,
which later acts as a wing to bear it away on the wind.</p>

<p>The <i>wood</i> is light, soft, tough, not durable, light brown
in color. It is used in the manufacture of pulp, woodenware,
furniture, trunks, excelsior and many other articles.</p>

<p>It makes a fine shade tree, grows rapidly and is easily
transplanted.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The white basswood, <i>Tilia heterophylla</i> Vent., is similar to the preceding
species, but with somewhat lighter bark. The leaves are larger, dark

Leaf and flowers, one-half natural size.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twig, two-thirds natural size.</p>

<p>The <i>leaves</i> are opposite, ovate, 3 to 5 inches long, 2 to 3
inches wide, pointed, entire or wavy on the margin, bright green
above, pale green or grayish beneath.</p>

<p>The <i>flowers</i>, which unfold from the conspicuous round,
grayish, winter flower buds before the leaves come out, are small
greenish-yellow, arranged in dense heads surrounded by large
white or rarely pinkish petal-like bracts, which give the appearance
of large spreading flowers 2 to 4 inches across.</p>

<p>The <i>fruit</i> is a bright scarlet &#8220;berry&#8221;, &frac12; inch long and
containing a hard nutlet in which are 1 or 2 seeds. Usually
several fruits, or &#8220;berries&#8221;, are contained in one head. They are
relished by birds, squirrels and other animals.</p>

<p>The <i>wood</i> is hard, heavy, strong, very close-grained, brown
to red in color. It is in great demand for cotton-mill machinery,
turnery handles and forms. One other tree has quite similar
wood&mdash;the persimmon.</p>

<p>The dogwood, with its masses of early spring flowers, its
dark red autumn foliage and its bright red berries, is probably
our most ornamental native tree. It should be used much more
extensively in roadside and ornamental planting.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The alternate-leaved dogwood, <i>Cornus alternifolia</i> L., occasionally
reaches tree size with long slender branches arranged in irregular whorls
giving the tree a storied effect. The flowers are small, followed by blue-black

<p class="center">SOUR GUM<br />
One-half natural size.</p>

<p>The <i>leaves</i> are simple, 2 to 3 inches long, entire, often
broader near the apex, shiny, dark green in color. In the fall
the leaves turn a most brilliant red.</p>

<p>The <i>bark</i> on younger trees is furrowed between flat ridges,
and gradually develops into quadrangular blocks that are dense,
hard and nearly black. Most of the branches are nearly horizontal.</p>

<p>The greenish <i>flowers</i> on long slender stems appear in early
spring when the leaves are about one-third grown. They are
usually of two kinds, the male in many-flowered heads and the
female in two to several-flowered clusters on different trees. The
<i>fruit</i> is a dark blue, fleshy berry, &#8532; of an inch long, containing
a single hard-shelled seed, and is borne on long stems, 2 to 3
in a cluster.</p>

<p>The <i>wood</i> is very tough, cross-grained, not durable in contact
with the soil, hard to work, and warps easily. It is used for
crate and basket veneers, box shooks, rollers, mallets, rough
floors, mine trams, pulpwood and fuel.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The tupelo gum, or cotton gum, <i>Nyssa aquatica</i> L., is found in deep
river swamps which are flooded during a part of the year. It occurs in 4 or
5 of the southern counties of Illinois in cypress swamps. The enlarged base
and the larger fruit serve to distinguish it from the sour gum. This fruit
or &#8220;plum&#8221; is about an inch long, dark purple and has a tough skin enclosing
a flattened stone. The wood is light, soft, and not strong and is used for
woodenware, handles, fruit and vegetable packages.</p></div>

throughout its range. It is a small tree, rarely exceeding 50
feet in height and 1 inch in diameter, occurring throughout
the State from the southern part north to Peoria County. It
seems to prefer dry, open situations, and is most abundant in the
old fields, though it also occurs on rich bottom lands. The <i>bark</i>

<p>The small <i>flowers</i>, which appear in May, are yellowish or
creamy white, somewhat bell-shaped, the two kinds occurring on
separate trees; the male in clusters of 2 or 3, the female solitary.
They are visited by many insects.</p>

<p>The <i>fruit</i> is a pulpy, round, orange-colored or brown berry,
an inch or more in diameter and containing several flattened,
hard, smooth seeds. It is strongly astringent while green, but
quite sweet and delicious when thoroughly ripe.</p>

<p>The <i>wood</i> is hard, dense, heavy, strong, the heartwood brown
or black, the wide sapwood white or yellowish. It is particularly
valued for shuttles, golf-stick heads, and similar special uses,
but is not of sufficient commercial use to warrant its general
encouragement as a timber tree.</p>

<h4><b>DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION<br />
Division of Forestry</b></h4>

<p>The State Division of Forestry was organized in 1926 as a
division of the Department of Conservation. It was organized
at that time as a result of an increased need for proper forestry
practices within the State on the part of the owners of timber
land and potential timber lands.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>The objectives of the Division are as follows:</p>

<p class="indent">1. To promote and assist in the reforestation of idle lands
unfit for agriculture.</p>

<p class="indent">2. To prevent and control woods fires.</p>

<p class="indent">3. To control erosion by the planting of trees.</p>

<p class="indent">4. To establish State forests to act as demonstration areas
in timber land management.</p>

<p class="indent">5. To assist Illinois farmers, landowners, and corporations
in woodland management practices.</p>

<p class="indent">6. To assist in the establishment of county and community
forests.</p>

<p class="indent">7. To disseminate forestry knowledge through the publication
of forestry literature.</p>

</div>

<h4><b>Reforestation</b></h4>

<p>Illinois has within its total land area of approximately
35,800,000 acres, 2,500,000 acres of land that should be reforested.
These lands are lying idle at present due to the fact that
they are too poor for agricultural purposes. As such they provide
an economic burden to their owners and to the State because
they are unproductive. These same lands will grow trees profitably,
therefore, it is necessary that they be planted to trees for a
future timber crop which ultimately will bring a revenue to the
landowners and community.</p>

<p>To meet this situation, the Department of Conservation,
Division of Forestry has developed two large forest tree nurseries
capable of producing 15,000,000 trees annually for reforestation
and erosion control purposes. These trees are available to
farmers and landowners at prices varying from $5.00 to $15.00
per thousand, dependent upon the species of trees desired. Trees
secured from the State must be used only for reforestation and
erosion control and cannot be used for landscape or ornamental
plantings.</p>

<p>Definite progress has been made in the State reforestation
program of idle lands. The first major distribution of trees took
place in 1936 at which time 300,000 trees were planted in the
State. Since 1936 the State&#8217;s reforestation program has steadily<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
been enlarged to the extent that in 1940, 6,250,000 trees were
distributed from State nurseries and in 1954, 9,996,000 trees left
the Division&#8217;s nurseries to be planted by farmers and public
agencies in the State.</p>

<p>Considerable progress has been made, however, it is hoped
that the reforestation program in Illinois will continue to expand
until all idle lands in Illinois are growing a useful timber crop.</p>

<h4><b>Forest Fire Protection</b></h4>

<p>Woodland fires in Illinois always present a serious problem
to the future growth and quality of our forests. Thousands of
dollars worth of damage is done annually to our existing woodlands
by fires which not only destroy our merchantable timber
but also cause severe mortality to young forest seedlings. Fires
seriously affect the soil, destroy wildlife and disrupt the entire
biological balance of the forest. Every effort should be made,
therefore, to prevent woods fires.</p>

<p>In 1938 the State Division of Forestry inaugurated a program
in forest fire protection. Since that time ten fire protection
districts and a forest fire protection headquarters have been
established in southern Illinois. Fire fighting personnel has been
hired, radio communication established, and ten State forest
fire towers have been erected. Fire protection has been established
on all State forests. Necessary tools and equipment for use
by both forestry personnel and volunteer groups have been purchased.
As a result, 3,674,000 acres of State and private land are
now receiving fire protection. This program will be enlarged as
funds permit until all woodland acreage in need of protection
will receive necessary fire protection.</p>

<p>Our forest resources are a valuable asset to Illinois and one
of the most valuable renewable resources that we have. They can
only be so, however, if adequate forest fire protection is afforded
them.</p>

<h4><b>Woodland Management</b></h4>

<p>Illinois&#8217; total forest acreage, when our first settlers came to
the State, included 15,273,000 acres of the finest timber to be
found in the Middle West. This represented 42 per cent of the
total acreage. Although Illinois today is considered strictly an
agricultural State, at one time we were rich in forest resources
and they were the State&#8217;s most valuable asset. Today Illinois
has but 3,996,000 acres of woodlands of which 92% is in private
ownership. The trained foresters of the Division of Forestry
are making every effort to assist farmers and landowners in
their woodland management problems. It is vitally necessary
that proper forestry practices be conducted on our woodlands
today in order that the landowners realize an income from their
forest lands and thereby make them an asset rather than a
liability. Advice on woodland management is available free of
charge from the Division.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>The marketing and proper utilization of our existing forest
resources is the concern of the Division of Forestry. Approximately
1,000 small sawmills are operating in the State and, of
course, much timber is needed annually to keep such mills in
operation. Every effort is being made to advise timber landowners
as to proper cutting practices and disposal of merchantable
timber.</p>

<h4><b>State Forests</b></h4>

<p>The State at present has 10,110 acres in State forests. It is
hoped that this acreage can be enlarged in future years as State
appropriations permit. The above acreage includes three State
forests located in Union, Mason and Henderson counties. Illinois
State forests will always be smaller than those of other states because
of the unavailability of low valued land. The Division&#8217;s
proposed State forest plan provides for a large number of small
State forests throughout the State which would serve as ideal
examples of proper woodland management and reforestation
practices. As funds permit these will be acquired in the future.</p>

<p>Our State forests provide ideal recreational areas at present
and thousands of visitors use them annually. In addition, as the
timber matures on them, they will provide a revenue from timber
sales and become self-sustaining.</p>

<h4><b>Community Forests</b></h4>

<p>Community forests are the oldest type of forest lands in
public ownership. Some have been in existence for 200 years in
the eastern states and records of older community forests have
been found in some of the European countries. The Division of
Forestry is cooperating with counties and communities in an
effort to get a large scale community forest program in Illinois.
To date there are 58 community forests having a total acreage
of 52,296 acres. Up to the present time 700,000 trees have been
planted on these areas in cooperation with the Division of
Forestry.</p>

<p>Nine counties in the State have County Forest Preserve
Districts at present. The ratio of ten acres for each 1,000
population within the county appears to be a fair goal for county
forest preserve systems in accordance with the Illinois State
Planning Commission. On this basis 19 counties in Illinois should
have forest preserves.</p>

<h4><b>Summary</b></h4>

<p>As a result of increased appropriations for forestry in recent
years a definite well-planned forestry program is in effect in
Illinois. For additional information on the Division&#8217;s activities,
write the State Forester, Springfield.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
